# argoproj-labs

This org is managed by the Argo project maintainers and not part of
the CNCF Argo umbrella projects. New repos in this org need to be
sponsored and created by one of the Argo project maintainers. The goal
is to have a place to collaborate with the community to quickly run
experiments, POCs and possibly new features to be later incorporated
in one of the Argo projects.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
